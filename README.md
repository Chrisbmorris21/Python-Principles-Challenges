My attemps at the Python Principles code challenges

Challenge #1
Write a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters.

For example, calling capital_indexes("HeLlO") should return the list [0, 2, 4].


Firstly I take a look at the non-negotiables of what is being asked. What parameters must I pass, and what must I return?
The non-negotiables in this case is that the function needs to be called **capital_indexes**. It can only take a **single parameter** and that must be a **string**.
My function should then return a **list** of all **indexes** that have capital letters.

By analysing a question in such a way, a lot of the work around the structure is already done for us. It also makes it easy to break down what it is to reference in the event there was something that came up I didn't already know before.
